# Large Scale Search Engine
It is a small prototype of a real-world search engine like Google. It works on millions of Wikipedia pages which are in XML format. Web Page data was preprocessed, cleaned and tokenized. Stop words were removed and stemming was done to bring the word to its base word using various stemming algorithms. An inverted index was created that will be around 7 to 9 GB. Once the query is given, it retrieves relevant ranked documents using a ranking algorithm and their titles using this index.
